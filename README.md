# CustomModpack
I don't take any credit for any of the mods in here or the config, the config was from crazycraft 3 but I added a few more things to it. As of
now, just put the mods in the mods folder and extract the folder inside config.zip into the config folder.

  **I recomend using MultiMC so you don't mess up mincraft's files**
